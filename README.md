#  Colorado Election Audit

Using python to automate the election audit process
-------

#### Overview of Project
 Tom, A colorado Board of Elections employee has tasked me to complete an election audit of a recent colorado cogressional election. Tom wants to calculate

1. The total number of votes cast.

2. compete list of condidates who received votes.

3. The total number of votes each candidate reDetermine the winner of the elceived.

4. The percentage of votes each candidate won.

5. The winner of the election based on popular vote.


#### Resources
Source of Data: 
[election_results.csv](https://github.com/mattstreet16/Election-Analysis/files/8241755/election_results.csv)

Software: Software: Python 3.7, Visial Studio Code,


#### Results/Analysis
There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.

The candidates and results: 

Charles Casper Stockham 23.0% (85,213 total votes)

Diana DeGette  73.8%  (272,892 total votes)

Raymon Anthony Doane 3.1%  (11,606 total votes)

The winner of the Election was Diana DeGette 73.8%  (272,892 total votes)


#### Project Summary
Using python to compelete the election audit offered the colorado board of elections the chance to automate the process and with a few simple adjustments the code will work for many other types of elections. 

 
 #### Challenge Overview
 
The election commission has requested some additional data to complete the audit so I had to calculate: 

1.The voter turnout for each county

2.The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count

3.The county with the highest turnout
 
 
 #### Challenge Results
 
The voter turnout by county and percentage:

Jefferson county received 10.5% of the vote and 38,855 total votes.

Denver county received 82.8% of the votes and 306,055.

Arapahoe county received 6.7% of the vote and 24,801 total votes.

Highest Voter Turnout:

Denver county received 82.8% of the votes and 306,055.


#### Challenge Summary
Because the original PyPoll code can be so easily adapted it wasn't difficult to adjust the code to calculate the additional information.
