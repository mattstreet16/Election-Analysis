#  Colorado Election Audit

Using python to automate the election audit process

By creating a script in python that will open and read the csv file Tom has provided, I can further calculate the total votes cast, complete list of candidates with a vote, the total number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of the votes won, and finally the winner of the election.
